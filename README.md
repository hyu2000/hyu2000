👋 Hello there!

👀 I’m interested in machine learning and coding in general. Have a background in speech recognition (pre-deep learning revolution).

🌱 I’m currently reading [Deep Learning and the Game of Go](https://github.com/maxpumperla/deep_learning_and_the_game_of_go). Same with the authors, I am a big [Go fan](http://tromp.github.io/gostory.html) and try to replicate AlphaGo(Zero), with a six-years old MacbookPro.

Well, so far I was successful in training a small policy network to predict expert moves in TF2 on Google's cloud GPU. Currently working on adopting MCTS and dual-network in the AGZ style. And along the way I learned of similar efforts like MuGo, MiniGo and the ever-improving KataGo.

💞️ If you are interested in collaboration, drop me a line via gmail, same username.
